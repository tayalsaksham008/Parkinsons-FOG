# Parkinson's Freezing of Gait Syndrome Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting Freezing of Gait (FOG) episodes in patients with Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression and LightGBM models.

## Introduction

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement. Freezing of Gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom characterized by brief, involuntary gait arrests. This project aims to predict FOG episodes to facilitate timely interventions and improve patient quality of life.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains [description of dataset, source, size, features, etc.].

## Models

Two machine learning models are employed for prediction:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective classification algorithm modeling the probability of a binary outcome.
2. **LightGBM**: A gradient boosting framework known for its speed and efficiency in handling large datasets.

## Results

Evaluation metrics used: [insert evaluation metrics]. Results summary: [brief summary of results].

## Usage

To use the code in this repository:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
