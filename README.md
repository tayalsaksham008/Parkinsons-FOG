Introduction
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. Freezing of Gait (FOG) is one of the most disabling symptoms for patients with Parkinson's disease, characterized by episodes of brief, involuntary gait arrests. Predicting these episodes can help in providing timely interventions and improving the quality of life for patients.

This project utilizes machine learning models to predict FOG episodes based on various features extracted from sensor data and clinical assessments.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains [description of dataset, source, size, features, etc.].

Models
Two machine learning models have been employed for prediction:

Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is a simple yet effective classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome.
LightGBM: LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms and is known for its speed and efficiency.
Results
The performance of the models was evaluated using [insert evaluation metrics]. Results showed [brief summary of results].
